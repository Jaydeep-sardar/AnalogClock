## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the clock
- **CSS3** – Clock face styling, rotations, positioning
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Real-time hand animation

---

## ▶️ How It Works

- The clock has 3 div elements for hour, minute, and second hands.
- CSS variables control hand color and length.
- JavaScript fetches the current time using the `Date` object.
- It calculates rotation angles and applies them to the hands every second using `setInterval`.
